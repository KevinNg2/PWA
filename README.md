# Text Editor

## Description
Text Editor is a simple text editor app that functions both online and offline. It features a variety of data persistence options to ensure that no data is lost. This application implements methods for retrieving and storing data to a `IndexedDB` database. It uses the `idb` package (lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API.)
